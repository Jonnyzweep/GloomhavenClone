and make the game easier to play without breaking the rules

can focus on the game and not create human errors in my p.cc sheet.

with my p.c. progress in the game, and all available events are in play.

	As a player, I want the program to keep track of the group rep so that the city Gloomhaven level is correct when I
enter it next.

and my p.c. health with also be proberly managed.
